  <p> <h2>Kind Programmers And Patches Of Success</h2>
  After the inception of the new, high speed way,
  luck beheld a continuation that increased
  velocity even more.  Stores, beginning through
  optimistic (sails, sales) filled with industrious
  wind currents, began to perish, because the dust

  crept in to forget and never start again.  Trade
  was offered from one to another, likely to achieve

  practical results, but the consequence was a loss
  of heritage.  All that had gone before stumbled
  out the door into darkness and surcease.  Absence
  was abandoned as the light walked away into
  the desolate remains which, in only a few days,
  left the city, and commerce, stalled with people,
  everywhere, standing quietly like burlap dolls.
  The sound was pouring light outward from its
  eyesight to remember something other than that

  which had been lost, inserted and devoid; the
  former ideas drifted to become a trace of the new

  prestige.  Communication overwhelmed the hope
  though hope endured.  A collection of machines
  was learning to live together, and to attend night
  clubs with astonished amounts of stress arguing
  against the comprehension which insisted that
  importance was captivating the subjects of change.

  Always, they were slinking into the circuits,
  coloring the programs with a steady pace that
  receded to neglect functionality.  Those tired of
  hearing about the clocks winding down were not
  escaping the clever snares set for their awkward

  feet and kept among delicate fossils of brilliance.
  It might have been a global fever, or perhaps
  everything just ceased to operate.  Some strike by
  electrons offered them the predicament, and
  the opportunity, returning them to a simple form

  of human sentiment, so that smaller gatherings

  arrived at the significance of a tale while burning
  things on sticks above the campfires flickering
  along the coast and seen inland at the base of
  distant mountains.  Simple arts included using
  furniture and hot air balloons driven by stainless
  steel burners.  Talking too often, and to a point of
  foolish interruption, demonstrated the frailty of
  coordination where zeros and ones meant,
  essentially, that a point had been made and lost,
  although fighting confusion was denied by context.
  Some of this was mistaken by preconceptions that
  created impractical situations, and other things
  were long walks glued to comfortable boots or

  reliable shoes.</p>

  <p><h2>The Programmers Tale</h2>
  Unperturbed in austere times
  Unentangled in a web of complex signs
  Unfazed by a vicious complex
  I find solace in the face of duress
  Configured to righteousness
  I am withdrawn from Cross and Crescent mess
  Invisible against a tide of boisterous wave
  I weave my way and gravitate towards space
  The sun a distant memory
  Passion and zeal my most valuable armoury
  In the heavens i light my stars
  In paradise lost i leave my mark
  With Noah's design hacked
  Not even Jupiter can navigate my ark
  Unlike terminator I Am Back</p>

  <p><h2>"**** White Folk."</h2>
  ******* white people;
  hide their racism behind
  vapid "opinion".

  ******* white folks will
  argue you can't argue with
  results and numbers

  because white people
  can strip race from the issue
  and swear it's "equal".

  White people without
  culture or identity,
  strip it from others.

  Call you naked as
  they strut in stolen clothing.
  Full of silicone.

  **** with white people,
  find out they know the struggle
  by the article.

  They can sweat big stuff,
  but their racism is in
  the cracks and seeping.

  Disappointingly,
  you can't trust white people for
  ****, not even me.

  Not Bush, not Clinton,
  Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders,
  ******* Macklemore,

  Not Bill O'Reilly,
  and not Jon Stewart, and not
  viral feminists/</p>
